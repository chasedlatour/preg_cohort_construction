# Objetives

The goal of this program is to describe the pregnancy cohorts created for each analytic dataset.

# Data

First, we must read in the necessary data files. 

```{r}

describe <- tar_read(all_descriptives)

```

# Describe the Cohort

Create kable with description of a specified dataset. Do this for each RR combination.

## $RR_{Preeclampsia} = 0.8, RR_{Abortion} = 0.8$

```{r}

# num_packs <- nrow(describe)/2

describe %>% 
  filter(rr_abortion == 0.8 & rr_preec == 0.8) %>% 
  select(marginal_p_miss_severity, marginal_p_miss_miscarriage,
         trt, n_low:missing_mnar_t) %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  collapse_rows(col_names = c(marginal_p_miss_severity, marginal_p_miss_miscarriage),
                valign = "top") %>% 
  kable_classic()
      



```
