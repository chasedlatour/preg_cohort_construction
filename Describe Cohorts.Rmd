The goal of this program is to describe the pregnancy cohorts created for each analytic dataset.

First, we must read in the necessary data files. 

```{r}

## Trt-Abortion = 0.8, -Preec = 0.8

#### Missing: Beta1 = 0.01, Gamma0 = 0.1, Gamma1 = 0.001
test <- readRDS("ab08preec08_beta001_gamma01_001.rds")

#### Missing: Beta1 = 0.05, Gamma0 = 0.1, Gamma1 = 0.02
test <- readRDS("ab08preec08_beta005_gamma01_002.rds")


```

## Summary Statistics, Ignoring Missingness

```{r}

# Focus on MAR + MNAR for now
test %>% 
  group_by(trt, severity) %>% 
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    # Distribution of outcomes
    n_miscarriage_all = sum(pregout_pre_miss == "fetaldeath" & pregout_t_pre_miss < 20),
    n_stillbirth_all = sum(pregout_pre_miss == "fetaldeath" & pregout_t_pre_miss >= 20),
    n_livebirth_all = sum(pregout_pre_miss == "livebirth"),
    # Distribution of observed outcomes
    n_miscarriage_obs = sum(pregout_pre_miss == "fetaldeath" & pregout_t_pre_miss < 20 & ltfu_mar_mnar == "not"),
    n_stillbirth_obs = sum(pregout_pre_miss == "fetaldeath" & pregout_t_pre_miss >= 20 & ltfu_mar_mnar == "not"),
    n_livebirth_obs = sum(pregout_pre_miss == "livebirth" & ltfu_mar_mnar == "not"),
    # Distribution by first pnc encounter
    n_pnc_4 = sum(pnc_wk == 4),
    n_pnc_7 = sum(pnc_wk == 7),
    n_pnc_16 = sum(pnc_wk == 16),
    .groups = 'keep'
  )

## QUESTION -- IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE AN OUTCOME AT 20 WEEKS OF GESTATION?? CHECK THIS -- SURPRISED SEE NONE.
## Seeing no stillbirths in trt'd in highest severity - make sure that there's not a systematic reason for that.
# Should severity influence the timing of the first PNC encounter? Feels like a bit too much to do.

```
