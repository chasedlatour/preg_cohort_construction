```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Pull in the necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

```

# Summary

The goal of this program is to create the cohorts of interest and then describe them.

First, we pull in the files that we need (i.e., files where functions are stored).

```{r}

# Pull in the data generation functions - These functions create the raw data
source("Data generation functions.R")

# Pull in the cohort creation functions - These functions actually create the analytic cohorts from the raw data
source("create cohort functions.R")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
